       ">The nature of life is one of the most fundamental and enduring questions in philosophy, science, and religion. Life is generally defined as the condition of an organism that demonstrates biological processes, such as metabolism, growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli. However, there is no scientific consensus on a single, universal definition of life. The Scientific American article \"What is Life?\" by Michael Hanlon, argues that the closest we have to a universal definition is \"living things are open dissipative systems that maintain homeostasis.\" In other words, living things are able to take in energy from their environment and use it to maintain their own internal organization.\n",
       ">\n",
       ">Some common characteristics of living organisms include:\n",
       ">\n",
       ">* **Organization:** Living organisms are highly organized structures, with many levels of complexity, from the molecular to the macroscopic.\n",
       ">* **Metabolism:** Living organisms use energy to maintain their internal organization and to carry out life processes.\n",
       ">* **Growth:** Living organisms grow and develop over time, increasing in size and complexity.\n",
       ">* **Reproduction:** Living organisms reproduce, creating new individuals that share their genetic material.\n",
       ">* **Response to stimuli:** Living organisms respond to changes in their environment, such as changes in temperature, light, or food availability.\n",
       ">\n",
       ">The study of life is called biology, and it is a vast and complex field. Biologists study all aspects of living organisms, from their molecular structure to their behavior and ecology. The goal of biology is to understand the fundamental principles of life and to explain the diversity and complexity of the living world."
